# BirthdayNotes 

This code  will allow you to store friend names with DOB. So that we can get notifications and add to the calendar as well.

We Used MVVM Design Pattern to make this application so that we can write modular code.

This app supports both mode landscape and portrait.

Assumtion:
1. Date of birth will sync to the calendar using EventKit2. Local notification will fire on the day at 10am. (10am is fixed for the notification) we can change the time for fire notification.3. Budge will show on the icon.

Notes : App name is not appropriate with the functionality of the application. I made it due to some restrictions.
